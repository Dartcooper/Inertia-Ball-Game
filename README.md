# Inertia-Ball-Game
Arcade style game where 1-2 players can play localy and race through dangerous mazes with different types of obstacles and traps to a finish.
The players' ball characters keep inertia, so the game has a unique learning curve learning how to use the acceleration movement opposed to basic movement.
The player can take damage by hitting obstacles such as walls, which deal more damage based on how fast the ball is moving. Some obstacles will instantly destroy the ball. Whenever a player is destroyed, they respawn at the start of the maze.
